# Portal Input Fix
![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/RoccoDev/PortalInputFix/total.svg)

For use with **Forge 1.8.9 only**.

This mod backports a fix from Minecraft 1.12 that lets you input movement actions
right after closing GUIs.  
Since the "level download" screen is a GUI, this also fixes broken controls after entering
portals or changing worlds/dimensions (e.g. switching lobbies).

## Disclaimer
**This mod might <ins>not</ins> be allowed in every server.**

Since playing in 1.12 would basically give you the same experience, I'd recommend using this mod
**only on servers that support 1.12**.  
I am not responsible for any punishments related to this mod.
